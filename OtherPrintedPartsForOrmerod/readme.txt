Other printed parts for Ormerod
===============================

This folder contains designs for the following printed parts, that are for the Ormerod but not for the sensor board:

1. PSU enclosure: this is an enclosure to cover the wiring end of a 12V 300W power supply, to replace the ATX PSU supplied with the kit. It accommodates the following components, which can all be sourced from Maplin Electronics:

IEC mains inlet with switch a fuse
Neon indicator
20A locking connector for the 12V output

2. Spacers for Matt's y-belt fastening posts. Y-belt slippage is a common problem with Ormerods, and Matt's y-belt mounts solve the problem. However, getting the y-belt tension rightr can be tricky because the y-belt length can only be adjusted in multiples of a whole tooth. One solution is to print Matt's y-belt tensioning device too. A simpler solution is to print these spacers to insert under the y-belt posts. There are 3 different thicknesses of spacer in this print, which can be used individually or in combination.
