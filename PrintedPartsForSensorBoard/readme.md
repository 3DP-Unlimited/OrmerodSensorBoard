Printed parts to go with Ormerod sensor board
=============================================

To use the Ormerod sensor board you will need to print three parts:

1 Modified x-motor-bracket3: Modified x-motor bracket. This includes an extended x-homing tab to suit the new position of the IR sensor head. Not needed if you use a microswitch for x-homing instead.

2(a) Modified heatsink-duct12: Modified heatsink duct. This includes the mounting points for the sensor board.

2(b) one-piece-hotend-airduct-with-new-irsensor-2: Modified version of Matt's one-piece heatsink/fan duct. Thanks to Matt (iamburny) for modifying his design to add the supports and mounting holes for the sensor board. I have further modified his design by replacing the T-shaped cable tie point at the top centre by a cable tie loop at the top right, and making the cable management piece stronger. To use the one-piece duct you need to drill an additional hole in the heatsink so that you can rotate it 90 degrees.

3(a) Insulator: This prevents the board from shorting against the z-threaded rod or other metal parts if the print head moves beyond the intended x-homing position. Alternatively you can use Kim brown's safety cover, his files are http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:272634 for kit 2/3/4, and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:273055 for kits 4+ and 5.

3(b) Insulator-for-ultrasonic: Thicker insulator which includes a holder for the ultrasonic transducer. This is thicker and longer than 3(a) to ensure that it touches the Z-nut trap before the ultrasonic sensor touches the threaded rod. If you use this part, you may have to extend the x-homing tab even further in the X-direction than the modified x-motor bracket already does, for example by sticking a piece of white card on top of it.

3(c) Insulator-thick: Thick insulator, for use when the ultrasonic sensor is glued on the pcb behind and slightly to the left of the IR sensor.

Also in this folder:

BoardHolder: This can be fixed to the back of a solder stencil, allowing boards to be accurately aligned with the stencil prior to application of solder paste.

Many thanks to johneato for producing the STLs for the modified x-motor bracket and modified heatsink duct.
